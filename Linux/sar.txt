NAME
sar - Collect, report, or save system activity information.

SYNOPSIS
sar [ -A ] [ -b ] [ -B ] [ -C ] [ -d ] [ -h ] [ -i interval ] [ -p ] [ -q ] [ -r ] [ -R ] [ -S ] [ -t ] [ -u [ ALL ] ] [ -v ] [ -V ] [ -w ] [ -W ] [ -y ] [ -n { DEV | EDEV | NFS | NFSD | SOCK | IP | EIP | ICMP | EICMP | TCP | ETCP | UDP | ALL } ] [ -I { int | SUM | ALL | XALL } ] [ -P { cpu | ALL } ] [ -o [ filename ] | -f [ filename ] ] [ -s [ hh:mm:ss ] ] [ -e [ hh:mm:ss ] ] [ interval [ count ] ]

DESCRIPTION
The sar command writes to standard output the contents of selected cumulative activity counters in the operating system. The accounting system, based on the values in the count and interval parameters, writes information the specified number of times spaced at the specified intervals in seconds. If the interval parameter is set to zero, the sar command displays the average statistics for the time since the system was started. If the interval parameter is specified without the count parameter, then reports are generated continuously. The collected data can also be saved in the file specified by the -o filename flag, in addition to being displayed onto the screen. If filename is omitted, sar uses the standard system activity daily data file, the /var/log/sa/sadd file, where the dd parameter indicates the current day. By default all the data available from the kernel are saved in the data file.
The sar command extracts and writes to standard output records previously saved in a file. This file can be either the one specified by the -f flag or, by default, the standard system activity daily data file. 
Without the -P flag, the sar command reports system-wide (global among all processors) statistics, which are calculated as averages for values expressed as percentages, and as sums otherwise. If the -P flag is given, the sar command reports activity which relates to the specified processor or processors. If -P ALL is given, the sar command reports statistics for each individual processor and global statistics among all processors.
You can select information about specific system activities using flags. Not specifying any flags selects only CPU activity. Specifying the -A flag is equivalent to specifying -bBdqrRSvwWy -I SUM -I XALL -n ALL -u ALL -P ALL.
The default version of the sar command (CPU utilization report) might be one of the first facilities the user runs to begin system activity investigation, because it monitors major system resources. If CPU utilization is near 100 percent (user + nice + system), the workload sampled is CPU-bound. 
If multiple samples and multiple reports are desired, it is convenient to specify an output file for the sar command. Run the sar command as a background process. The syntax for this is: 
sar -o datafile interval count >/dev/null 2>&1 &
All data is captured in binary form and saved to a file (datafile). The data can then be selectively displayed with the sar command using the -f option. Set the interval and count parameters to select count records at interval second intervals. If the count parameter is not set, all the records saved in the file will be selected. Collection of data in this manner is useful to characterize system usage over a period of time and determine peak usage hours.
Note:   The sar command only reports on local activities.
OPTIONS

-A
This is equivalent to specifying -bBdqrRSvwWy -I SUM -I XALL -n ALL -u ALL -P ALL.

-b
Report I/O and transfer rate statistics. The following values are displayed:

tps 
Total number of transfers per second that were issued to physical devices. A transfer is an I/O request to a physical device. Multiple logical requests can be combined into a single I/O request to the device. A transfer is of indeterminate size.

rtps 
Total number of read requests per second issued to physical devices.

wtps 
Total number of write requests per second issued to physical devices.

bread/s 
Total amount of data read from the devices in blocks per second. Blocks are equivalent to sectors with 2.4 kernels and newer and therefore have a size of 512 bytes. With older kernels, a block is of indeterminate size.

bwrtn/s 
Total amount of data written to devices in blocks per second.

-B
Report paging statistics. Some of the metrics below are available only with post 2.5 kernels. The following values are displayed:

pgpgin/s 
Total number of kilobytes the system paged in from disk per second. Note: With old kernels (2.2.x) this value is a number of blocks per second (and not kilobytes).

pgpgout/s 
Total number of kilobytes the system paged out to disk per second. Note: With old kernels (2.2.x) this value is a number of blocks per second (and not kilobytes).

fault/s 
Number of page faults (major + minor) made by the system per second. This is not a count of page faults that generate I/O, because some page faults can be resolved without I/O.

majflt/s 
Number of major faults the system has made per second, those which have required loading a memory page from disk.

pgfree/s
Number of pages placed on the free list by the system per second.

pgscank/s
Number of pages scanned by the kswapd daemon per second.

pgscand/s
Number of pages scanned directly per second.

pgsteal/s
Number of pages the system has reclaimed from cache (pagecache and swapcache) per second to satisfy its memory demands.

%vmeff
Calculated as pgsteal / pgscan, this is a metric of the efficiency of page reclaim. If it is near 100% then almost every page coming off the tail of the inactive list is being reaped. If it gets too low (e.g. less than 30%) then the virtual memory is having some difficulty. This field is displayed as zero if no pages have been scanned during the interval of time.

-C
When reading data from a file, tell sar to display comments that have been inserted by sadc.

-d
Report activity for each block device (kernels 2.4 and newer only). When data is displayed, the device specification dev m-n is generally used (DEV column). m is the major number of the device. With recent kernels (post 2.5), n is the minor number of the device, but is only a sequence number with pre 2.5 kernels. Device names may also be pretty-printed if option -p is used (see below). Values for fields avgqu-sz, await, svctm and %util may be unavailable and displayed as 0.00 with some 2.4 kernels.

tps 
Indicate the number of transfers per second that were issued to the device. Multiple logical requests can be combined into a single I/O request to the device. A transfer is of indeterminate size.

rd_sec/s
Number of sectors read from the device. The size of a sector is 512 bytes.

wr_sec/s
Number of sectors written to the device. The size of a sector is 512 bytes.

avgrq-sz
The average size (in sectors) of the requests that were issued to the device.

avgqu-sz
The average queue length of the requests that were issued to the device.

await 
The average time (in milliseconds) for I/O requests issued to the device to be served. This includes the time spent by the requests in queue and the time spent servicing them.

svctm 
The average service time (in milliseconds) for I/O requests that were issued to the device.

%util 
Percentage of CPU time during which I/O requests were issued to the device (bandwidth utilization for the device). Device saturation occurs when this value is close to 100%.

-e [ hh:mm:ss ]
Set the ending time of the report. The default ending time is 18:00:00. Hours must be given in 24-hour format. This option can be used when data are read from or written to a file (options -f or -o ).

-f [ filename ]
Extract records from filename (created by the -o filename flag). The default value of the filename parameter is the current daily data file, the /var/log/sa/sadd file. The -f option is exclusive of the -o option.

-h
Display a short help message then exit.

-i interval
Select data records at seconds as close as possible to the number specified by the interval parameter.

-I { int | SUM | ALL | XALL }
Report statistics for a given interrupt. int is the interrupt number. Specifying multiple -I int parameters on the command line will look at multiple independent interrupts. The SUM keyword indicates that the total number of interrupts received per second is to be displayed. The ALL keyword indicates that statistics from the first 16 interrupts are to be reported, whereas the XALL keyword indicates that statistics from all interrupts, including potential APIC interrupt sources, are to be reported.

onort/s
The number of IP datagrams discarded per second because no route could be found to transmit them to their destination [ipOutNoRoutes]. Note that this counter includes any packets counted in fwddgm/s which meet this 'no-route' criterion. Note that this includes any datagrams which a host cannot route because all of its default routers are down.

asmf/s
The number of failures detected per second by the IP re-assembly algorithm (for whatever reason: timed out, errors, etc) [ipReasmFails]. Note that this is not necessarily a count of discarded IP fragments since some algorithms can lose track of the number of fragments by combining them as they are received.

fragf/s

The ALL keyword is equivalent to specifying all the keywords above and therefore all the network activities are reported. 

-o [ filename ]
Save the readings in the file in binary form. Each reading is in a separate record. The default value of the filename parameter is the current daily data file, the /var/log/sa/sadd file. The -o option is exclusive of the -f option.

-P { cpu | ALL }
Report per-processor statistics for the specified processor or processors. Specifying the ALL keyword reports statistics for each individual processor, and globally for all processors. Note that processor 0 is the first processor.

-p
Pretty-print device names. Use this option in conjunction with option -d. By default names are printed as dev m-n where m and n are the major and minor numbers for the device. Use of this option displays the names of the devices as they (should) appear in /dev. Name mappings are controlled by /etc/sysconfig/sysstat.ioconf.

-q
Report queue length and load averages. The following values are displayed:

runq-sz 
Run queue length (number of tasks waiting for run time).

plist-sz 
Number of tasks in the process list.

ldavg-1

ldavg-15 
System load average for the past 15 minutes.

-r
Report memory utilization statistics. The following values are displayed:

kbbuffers 
Amount of memory used as buffers by the kernel in kilobytes.

kbcached 
Amount of memory used to cache data by the kernel in kilobytes.

kbcommit 
Amount of memory in kilobytes needed for current workload. This is an estimate of how much RAM/swap is needed to guarantee that there never is out of memory.

%commit 
Percentage of memory needed for current workload in relation to the total amount of memory (RAM+swap). This number may be greater than 100% because the kernel usually overcommits memory.

-R
Report memory statistics. The following values are displayed:

frmpg/s 
Number of memory pages freed by the system per second. A negative value represents a number of pages allocated by the system. Note that a page has a size of 4 kB or 8 kB according to the machine architecture.

bufpg/s 
Number of additional memory pages used as buffers by the system per second. A negative value means fewer pages used as buffers by the system.

campg/s 
Number of additional memory pages cached by the system per second. A negative value means fewer pages in the cache.

-S
Report swap space utilization statistics. The following values are displayed:

kbswpfree 
Amount of free swap space in kilobytes.

kbswpused 
Amount of used swap space in kilobytes.

%swpused 
Percentage of used swap space.

kbswpcad 
Amount of cached swap memory in kilobytes. This is memory that once was swapped out, is swapped back in but still also is in the swap area (if memory is needed it doesn't need to be swapped out again because it is already in the swap area. This saves I/O).

%swpcad
Percentage of cached swap memory in relation to the amount of used swap space.

-s [ hh:mm:ss ]
Set the starting time of the data, causing the sar command to extract records time-tagged at, or following, the time specified. The default starting time is 08:00:00. Hours must be given in 24-hour format. This option can be used only when data are read from a file (option -f ).

-t
When reading data from a daily data file, indicate that sar should display the timestamps in the original locale time of the data file creator. Without this option, the sar command displays the timestamps in the user's locale time.

-u [ ALL ]
Report CPU utilization. The ALL keyword indicates that all the CPU fields should be displayed. The report may show the following fields:

%user 
Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the user level (application). Note that this field includes time spent running virtual processors.

%usr
Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the user level (application). Note that this field does NOT include time spent running virtual processors.

%nice 
Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the user level with nice priority.

%system 
Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the system level (kernel). Note that this field includes time spent servicing interrupts and softirqs.

%sys
Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the system level (kernel). Note that this field does NOT include time spent servicing interrupts or softirqs.

%iowait 
Percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle during which the system had an outstanding disk I/O request.

%guest
Percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to run a virtual processor.

%idle 
Percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle and the system did not have an outstanding disk I/O request.

Note: On SMP machines a processor that does not have any activity at all (0.00 for every field) is a disabled (offline) processor.

-v
Report status of inode, file and other kernel tables. The following values are displayed:

dentunusd 
Number of unused cache entries in the directory cache.

file-nr 
Number of file handles used by the system.

inode-nr 
Number of inode handlers used by the system.

pty-nr

ENVIRONMENT
The sar command takes into account the following environment variables:
S_TIME_FORMAT
If this variable exists and its value is ISO then the current locale will be ignored when printing the date in the report header. The sar command will use the ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD) instead.
S_TIME_DEF_TIME
If this variable exists and its value is UTC then sar will save its data in UTC time (data will still be displayed in local time). sar will also use UTC time instead of local time to determine the current daily data file located in the /var/log/sa directory.
EXAMPLES

sar -u 2 5 
Report CPU utilization for each 2 seconds. 5 lines are displayed.

sar -I 14 -o int14.file 2 10 
Report statistics on IRQ 14 for each 2 seconds. 10 lines are displayed. Data are stored in a file called int14.file.

sar -r -n DEV -f /var/log/sa/sa16 
Display memory and network statistics saved in daily data file 'sa16'.

sar -A 
Display all the statistics saved in current daily data file.
BUGS
/proc filesystem must be mounted for the sar command to work.
All the statistics are not necessarily available, depending on the kernel version used.
FILES
/var/log/sa/sadd
Indicate the daily data file, where the dd parameter is a number representing the day of the month. 
/proc contains various files with system statistics.
